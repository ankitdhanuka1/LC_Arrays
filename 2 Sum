Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Solution:
1. Use an unordered_map<int, int> map
2. for each nums[i], check if target - nums[i] is there in map or not. If found, store the indexes of i and index found in map in resutant vector.
                result.push_back(i);
                result.push_back(map[target - nums[i]]);
3. Else store the number and index in map. 
                map[nums[i]] = i
