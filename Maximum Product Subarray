Given an integer array nums, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.

Solution:
Calculate curmax = max(nums[i], nums[i]*curmax, nums[i]*curmin), and calculate curmin = min(nums[i], nums[i]*curmax, nums[i]*curmin).
curmin is needed because if nums[i] is negative , then multiplying it by lowest negative curmin will give the highest vale;
calculate maxprod = max(maxprod, curmax)
return maxprod as answer.
